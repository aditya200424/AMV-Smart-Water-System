# AMV-Smart-Water-System
Designed and implemented an IoT water monitoring system utilizing the ESP32 platform. This system provides comprehensive measurement of water usage (flow), quality (TDS), and pressure, featuring real-time data upload, dashboard visualization, and automated alert functionality both hardware and software



# 💧 Smart Water Quality & Water Efficiency Monitoring System

This repository contains our combined **hardware + software IoT project** focused on
monitoring water quality, water usage, and promoting efficient water management.

The system measures real-time water parameters, sends data to the ESP32,
and displays analytics on a webpage — helping households and cities
**save water, detect wastage, and improve water quality.**

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 🔹 Hardware: Smart Water Quality Checker
Our hardware device is a **portable, low-cost system** that measures:

- pH Level  
- TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)  
- Water Temperature  

The readings are processed using **ESP32** and displayed on a **16×2 LCD**.  
This helps monitor drinking water quality at home and in the field.

### 🔹 Software: Water Efficiency System (Web Dashboard)

We developed a web-based monitoring platform that tracks:

- Water supply
- Flow rate
- Water pressure
- TDS
- Real-time usage trends

Data is sent from ESP32 to the server using **WebSocket**, stored in a database,
and displayed on our dashboard. The system also includes:

- ⚠️ Alerts for abnormal water usage
- 🏆 Reward system for water-saving users
- 📊 Usage comparison dashboard
- 🌐 Contact & About pages
